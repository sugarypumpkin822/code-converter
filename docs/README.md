# Tests for CodeTranslator

## Running Tests
- Use `scripts/run_tests.sh` to run all tests.
- Or run individual test executables in the `tests/` directory.

## Writing Tests
- Add new test files as `test_*.cpp` in `tests/`.
- Use Qt Test or your preferred C++ testing framework.
- See `test_translator.cpp` for an example.

## Guidelines
- Cover new features and bug fixes with tests.
- Keep tests fast and independent.
